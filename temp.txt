Intro

1. Explain basics of how the api works
- Authentication
- Using same codebase as what is seen in the front end (controllers, services, etc)
- Above allows for parity of functionality, and speed improvements for complex tasks
2. Basic structure of data
- Query
- Response
3. How it can be used
- Command line, python, Ruby, R, Perl, C, etc
- fits use cases for single queries, complex scripting, reliable repeatable workflows
- Built in interactive page on irida next

Examples

1. Get samples in a project
- filtering
- advanced queries to get specific data on samples
2. How authorization works
- can't see data on projects/groups you don't have access to
3. Submitting a pipeline/workflow
- submission of pipeline
- status of pipeline
- results after completion
4. Uploading files
- Interacts with Azure cloud to allow direct file uploads that don't rely on HTTP so uploads are faster
- No demo for this
5. Metadata
- this is an important one I think so multiple complex queries
  - metadata on a project
  - all samples in a group that have metadata that matches multiple conditions
  - above with created date as another condition

Current Integrations

1. Power Bi
- need details on this
2. BDIP Drop
- need details
3. Scheduled pipelines
- need details
