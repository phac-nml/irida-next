In IRIDA Next, analysis of samples is performed using the Workflow Execution System (WES). This system allows you to run pipelines from within IRIDA Next. The analysis data can be stored and shared securely within IRIDA Next.

The WES runs pipelines written in Nextflow. The current list of Nextflow pipelines for use in IRIDA Next is available at https://github.com/phac-nml/nf-pipelines.

Users can also integrate their own Nextflow pipelines into IRIDA Next. For more information about pipeline integration, see Pipeline Development.
