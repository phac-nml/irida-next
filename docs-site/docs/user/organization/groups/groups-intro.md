# Groups

In IRIDA Next, you use groups to manage one or more related projects at the same time.

You can use groups to manage permissions for your projects. If someone has access to the group, they get access to all the projects in the group.

You can also create subgroups.

For more information about creating and managing your groups, see [Manage groups](manage).
