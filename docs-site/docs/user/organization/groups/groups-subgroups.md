# Subgroups

You can organize IRIDA Next groups into subgroups. You can use subgroups to:
* Separate organizations. You can host groups for different purposes under the same parent group.
* Manage people and control visibility. Give a user a different role for each group they're a member of.

Subgroups can:
* Belong to one immediate parent group.
* Have many subgroups.
* Be nested up to 10 levels.

1. On the top bar, select **Main menu > Groups** and find your group.
