# Subgroups

You can organize IRIDA Next groups into subgroups. You can use subgroups to:

- Separate organizations. You can host groups for different purposes under the same parent group.
- Manage people and control visibility. Give a user a different role for each group they're a member of.

Subgroups can:

- Belong to one immediate parent group.
- Have many subgroups.
- Be nested up to 10 levels.

1. On the top bar, select **Main menu > Groups** and find your group.
2. Select the **Subgroups and projects** tab.
3. To view a nested subgroup, expand a subgroup in the hierarchy list.
