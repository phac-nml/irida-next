In IRIDA Next you can invite a group to a group to allow the members of the group access to the shared group

## Share a group with a group

5. Select the **Maximum group access level**
6. Set an optional **Access expiration**. This will expire access to the group as of the selected date.
7. Select **Share**

## Maximum group access level

When you invite a group to a group, the maximum group access level is the highest level of access the invited group members are allowed to have in the shared group.

When multiple groups contain the same members, and the groups have access to the same shared project, the group members are given the highest access level of the two for the shared group.

The member’s Max role is the more restrictive of:

- The role the user is assigned for the group.
- The role you chose when you invited the group to the group.

2. Select **Members** from the left sidebar
