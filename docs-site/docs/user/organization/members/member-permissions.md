title: Permissions and Roles

When you add a user to a project or group, you assign them a role. The role determines which actions they can take in IRIDA Next.

If you add a user to both a project’s group and the project itself, the higher role is used.

## Roles

The available roles are:

- Guest
- Analyst
- Maintainer
- Owner

A user assigned the Guest role has the least permissions, and the Owner has the most.

All users can create top-level groups and projects.

## Group Members Permissions

Any user can remove themselves from a group, unless they are the last Owner of the group.

The following table lists group permissions available for each role:
