In IRIDA Next, members are the users and groups which have access to your project. Each member has a role, which determines what they can do or access in the project.

## Membership Types

IRIDA Next has four types of membership

| Membership Type  | Process                                                                      |
| :--------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Direct           | The user is added directly to the group or project                           |
| Inherited        | The user is a member of an ancestor group                                    |
| Direct Shared    | The user is a direct member of a group that the namespace is shared with     |
| Inherited Shared | The user is an inherited member of a group that the namespace is shared with |

## Direct Membership

When the project belongs to a group, if a user is added directly to a project, and that user is a member of a parent group or it's ancestors, the minimum role that the user could be assigned in the project is their maximum role in the parent group and it's ancestors.

For Example:

- User 0 is a member of Group 1 with **Maintainer** role
- Group 1 has a subgroup Subgroup 1
- Project 1 belongs to Subgroup 1
- The only roles that User 0 can be assigned in the project are **Maintainer** and **Owner**

## Inherited Membership

When the project belongs to a group, the members of this project will inherit their role from the group and it's ancestors.

For Example:

- User 0 is a Member of Group 1 with a **Maintainer** role
- Group 1 has a subgroup Subgroup 1
- Project 1 belongs to Subgroup 1
- User 0 has the inherited membership in Project 1 through the ancestor (Group 1) of Subgroup 1 with the **Maintainer** role

## Direct Shared Membership

When the project belongs to a group, if the project is shared directly with another group, the minimum of the effective group access level and the user's access level in their group applies

For Example:

- User 0 is a member of Group A with **Analyst** role
- Project 1 belongs to Group B
- Project 1 is shared with Group A with a group access level **Maintainer**
- User 0 will have a maximum role of **Analyst** from their group when accessing Project 1

## Inherited Shared Membership

When the project belongs to a group, and the group is shared with another group in which a user has membership, the minimum of the effective group access level and the user's access level in their group applies

For Example:

- User 0 is a member of Group A with **Analyst** role
- Project 1 belongs to Group B
- Group B is shared with Group A with a group access level **Maintainer**
- User 0 will have a maximum role of **Analyst** from their group when accessing Group B and it's descendants (subgroups and projects)
