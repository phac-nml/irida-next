In IRIDA Next, members are the users and groups which have access to your project. Each member has a role, which determines what they can do or access in the project.

## Membership Types

IRIDA Next has two types of membership

| Membership Type | Process                                            |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| Direct          | The user is added directly to the group or project |
| Inherited       | The user is a member of an ancestor group          |

## Direct Membership

When the project belongs to a group, if a user is added directly to a project, and that user is a member of a parent group or it's ancestors, the minimum role that the user could be assigned in the project is their maximum role in the parent group and it's ancestors.

For Example:

- User 0 is a member of Group 1 with **Maintainer** role
- Group 1 has a subgroup Subgroup 1
- Project 1 belongs to Subgroup 1
- The only roles that User 0 can be assigned in the project are **Maintainer** and **Owner**

## Inherited Membership

When the project belongs to a group, the members of this project will inherit their role from the group and it's ancestors.

For Example:

- User 0 is a Member of Group 1 with a **Maintainer** role
- Group 1 has a subgroup Subgroup 1
- Project 1 belongs to Subgroup 1
- User 0 has the inherited membership in Project 1 through the ancestor (Group 1) of Subgroup 1 with the **Maintainer** role

## Add members to a group

## Which roles you can assign

- Owner (40), if you have the Owner role for the project.
- Maintainer (30), if you have the Maintainer role on the project.
