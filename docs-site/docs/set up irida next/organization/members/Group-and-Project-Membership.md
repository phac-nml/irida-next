# Group and Project Membership

The list of members in a group/subgroup/project is visible on the respective **Members** page.

There are two types of membership in IRIDA Next: **Direct** and **Inherited**.

## Direct Membership
A direct membership means that a member is directly added to a group or project that they require access to.

## Inherited Membership
When the project belongs to a group, the members of this project will inherit their role from the group and it's ancestors.

An inherited membership means that membership in a group or project was not directly given to a member. Instead, the member already has membership in a “higher” or “ancestral” group within the organizational structure which results in “inherited” membership to all “lower” or “progeny” groups or projects.
