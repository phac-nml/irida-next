Projects are used to organize and manage samples. Samples are directly stored in projects. Samples cannot be stored within groups.

Projects are used for sample storage, sharing, and uploading within groups. You can also create projects that are not housed within a group (personal projects).

Access to projects can be granted either through direct user invitation or by inviting a group, which allows the group members to access the project. Once a user or group has been added to the project membership, they have access to the current contents of the project as well as any future additions.


## View a Project

Selecting **Projects** on the sidebar will bring you to your **Projects** page.

This page provides a list of all personal projects, projects that you are a member of, and projects that you gained access to via sharing with a group that you are a member of.

To view your personal projects, select the **Personal** tab. Personal projects are projects that you created outside of a group.

You can create a project:
1.	Within a group (preferred),
   **OR**
2.	Within your personal account (aka namespace)
