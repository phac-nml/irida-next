# Groups

Groups serve multiple functions within IRIDA Next.

Groups are the largest hierarchical unit within the file structure, meaning that all groups, projects, and samples are found within a larger group (except for personal projects). Groups also simplify the sharing of projects, groups, and files (results, etc.) with other users within IRIDA Next. If a user has access to the group, they automatically have access to all current and future projects within the group.

Groups can exist as either “subgroups” or “parent groups”. Subgroups are simply groups that exist within another group (a parent group). Parent groups do not exist within any other group.

The advantage of using this structure is that the parent group “permissions” (which users have access to the group) are automatically applied to all subgroups within the parent group.

On a practical level, this means that users only need to share a parent group once, and all current and future subgroups and their projects will be automatically shared.

For more information about creating and managing groups, see [Manage groups](manage).
