To begin using IRIDA Next, it is useful to start by creating an organizational structure for your projects.

There is no prescribed structure that must be used within IRIDA Next. Users are encouraged to create an organizational structure that works best for their operational needs.

IRIDA Next is designed to organize data hierarchically. From highest to lowest, the organizational levels consist of groups, projects, and samples.

# Groups
In IRIDA Next, you use groups to manage one or more related projects at the same time.

# Subgroups
You can organize IRIDA Next groups within groups. A group within another group is a “subgroup”. Subgroups have the same properties and functions as groups.

# Projects
Projects are used to organize and manage samples.

# Samples
Samples contain the files to be analyzed by IRIDA Next. Samples belong to projects.
