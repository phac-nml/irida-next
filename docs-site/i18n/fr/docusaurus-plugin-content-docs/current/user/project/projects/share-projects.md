## Maximum group access level

When you invite a group to a project, the maximum group access level is the highest level of access the invited group members are allowed to have in the project.

When multiple groups contain the same members, and the groups have access to the same project, the group members are given the highest access level of the two for the project.

The memberâ€™s Max role is the more restrictive of:

- The role the user is assigned for the group.
- The role you chose when you invited the group to the project.
