# Projects

Projects are used to organize and manage samples. They can belong to either a group (or subgroup) or a user.

Access to projects can be granted either through direct user invitation or inviting a group, allowing its members to access the project.

Through a project, automated analysis of samples can be set up. Follow these steps to learn how.
<!-- TODO: link steps to automated WE set up when available -->

Learn how to work with projects under [Manage Projects](manage-projects).
