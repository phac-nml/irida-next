# Manage Groups

Use groups to manage one or more related projects at the same time.

## View Groups

To view groups, on the top bar, select **Main menu > Groups > View all groups**.

The **Groups** page shows a list of groups, sorted by last updated date.
* To explore all public groups, select **Explore groups**.
* To view groups where you have a direct or indirect membership, select **Your groups**. This tab shows groups that you are a member of:
  * Through membership of a subgroup's parent group.
  * Through direct or inherited membership of a project in the group or subgroup.

## Create a group

To create a group:

  * To the left of the search box, select the plus sign and then **New group**.
2. Select **Create group**.
3. Enter a name for the group in **Group name**. For a list of words that cannot be used as group names, see [reserved names](../../project/projects/reserved-names).
4. Enter a path for the group in **Group URL**, which is used for the [namespace](../namespaces).

## Remove a group

To remove a group and its contents:
1. On the top bar, select **Main menu > Groups** and find your group.
2. On the left sidebar, select **Settings > General**.
3. Expand the **Advanced** section.
